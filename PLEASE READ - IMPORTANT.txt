Important: I used a mysql database to keep track of users, files names and their machine addresses, locks and read and write permissions (mapping user ids and file ids together). 
This database has been exported as an sql file and has been added to the File Server repository. The files I was using, however, were scattered across my system. I have added one of them to the project folder for testing purposes. 


In case there are any issues please feel free to call me anytime for a demonstration. Iâ€™m not going anywhere over the holiday period. Thank you
